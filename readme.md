# TODO
use fixed auth_token
wrap requests or even better use headers to pass in the token to rails

currently using http://matteomelani.wordpress.com/2011/10/17/authentication-for-mobile-devices/
maybe if token controller is changed to check headers, that would be better
but think about that only after you manage to wrap Task calls with auth token
